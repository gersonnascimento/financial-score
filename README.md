# Financial Score

This project is a pure ruby system, created for learning about clean architecture. I'm creating this project at the same time as I'm reading the Uncle Bob's book.

I'll start coding and improve the architecture according to the book content. There'll be a picture with the current state of my architecture each update.

# Scope

It's a system based on Serasa Xperian score service, which defines a financial score for people according to their daily payments. It's used for verifying if people can borrow money from banks, or if they can take a new credit card.
